  - How dare you talk to me like that!
  - And how dare you accuse the company of all of this.
  - We have done great things!
  - Like giving people jobs!
  - Look around you.
  - This city's a mess and people live in poverty while you get billions of dollars
    of profit.
  - "If your company was really that great, we wouldn\u2019t have to fight for our
    survival."
