  - "I don\u2019t see the big deal of all of this."
  - Climate change is a natural thing.
  - Besides, scientists themselves argue about the fact if climate change is real
    or not.
  - How am I to believe all of this?
  - The climate has changed in the past, yes.
  - We should use these historic increases in CO2 and greenhouse gasses as a warning!
  - It was incredibly harmful!
  - Almost 100% of scientists agree!
  - You should really check your sources.
