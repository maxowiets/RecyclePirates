  - Hey missy!
  - I see your social skills.
  - Our company can surely use that.
  - I could talk to the higher ups so they can hire you.
  - What do you say?
  - You are with The Corporation?
  - No thanks, you guys are way too harmful to the planet.
  - "Oh gosh, you are one of those climate change believers aren\u2019t you?"
  - Climate change is a real thing!
  - And we should all work together to prevent it as much as possible!
