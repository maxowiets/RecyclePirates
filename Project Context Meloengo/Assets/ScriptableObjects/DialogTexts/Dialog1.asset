  dialogText:
  - Hey, have you ever been to a climate change protest or engaged in activism?
  - It can be a powerful experience.
  - I am organizing one too, would you like to join?
  - I've never been part of any of those.
  - "I don\u2019t think protesting leads to major change, so I\u2019m not sure if
    participating is worthwhile."
  - Actually, protests have already led to some great victories, you know.
  - For instance, thousands of people protested in Germany to urge the government
    to phase out coal power.
  - The government also just declared that coal will be phased out by 2038.
  - That's quite impressive, but for some reason, I doubt this protest will have
    the same effect.
  - Every voice matters.
  - Have a look at the climate strikes organized by youth all across the world.
  - Millions of people have joined, young people, like Greta Thunberg, in calling
    for urgent climate action.
  - They started from a small group organizing demonstrations in their local areas,
    to now millions of people joining.
