  - Hey, I want to ask you something.
  - Have you given any attention to how big corporations are affecting our world
    and are negatively impacting the environment?
  - I have, what they do is definitely worrying.
  - It is disgusting how some businesses treat our world.
  - Exactly, that's why I believe we need to take action.
  - We can do that by protesting.
  - Are you interested in joining me to gather more people to protest?
