  - "I don\u2019t think so."
  - "Protests won\u2019t do anything, because the government won\u2019t do anything
    anyway."
  - What are they gonna do about it?
  - I understand your concern.
  - We can create unrest and shine a light on the problem.
  - We can put pressure on the government.
  - "And even if the government doesn\u2019t do anything, we can still sue those
    that are responsible and sign petitions."
