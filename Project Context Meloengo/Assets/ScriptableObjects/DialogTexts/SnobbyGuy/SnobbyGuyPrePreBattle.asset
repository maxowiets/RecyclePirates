  - I dunno.
  - "I haven\u2019t seen anything crucial on the web."
  - None of the influencers on Chatflix, InstandPic or YouVid are doing anything
    about it, so why should I!?
  - "Uhm\u2026 Well we do have to do something."
  - Look around you.
  - It is a mess!
  - But we can do something about it!
  - We just have to do it together as a collective.
  - I dunno about you, but I have better things to do.
  - Those clacks don't click themselves.
  - 'That might be so, but nothing will be solved if we stay passive and ignore the
    situation at hand! '
