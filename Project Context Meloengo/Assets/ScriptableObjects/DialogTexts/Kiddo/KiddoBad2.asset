  - Nature and technology are complete opposites, are they not?
  - It is a constant battle.
  - We cut trees to build shelter, we use fossil fuels to power out factories.
  - Technology has helped with preventing climate change.
  - It can bring us many wonderful things like solar panels and wind turbines.
  - Together, we can make really wonderful things!
